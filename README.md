## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key (optional for full features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alex-ia
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

4. **Run database migrations**
```bash
npm run migrations:check
```

5. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the application.

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run security checks
npm run security:check
```

### Test Coverage
We maintain a minimum of 70% test coverage across:
- Unit tests for components and hooks
- Integration tests for critical workflows
- Security tests for vulnerability detection

## üîí Security

### Environment Configuration
All sensitive data is managed through environment variables:
- API keys are never hardcoded
- Supabase RLS policies protect user data
- Regular security audits and dependency updates

### Security Features
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Input Validation**: XSS and injection prevention
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of exposed credentials

### Security Checklist

- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and compression
- **Service Worker**: Offline capability and caching

### Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3s
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80% for frequent queries
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with tree-shaking

## üöÄ Deployment

### Automated Deployment
The project includes CI/CD pipelines for:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Production hosting options
